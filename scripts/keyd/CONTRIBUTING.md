The best way to contribute is to file an issue with any bugs you find or any
features you think belong in keyd. Small issues pertaining to things like
compilation on different platforms can be submitted as PRs but please avoid
sending in patches which change core functionality without filing an issue
first. The key logic can be deceptively simple and contains a few subtleties
that need to be managed properly. Additionally, I reserve the right to reject
any features which I do not think belong in keyd.
